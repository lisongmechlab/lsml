How to get started with developing in LSML
------------------------------------------

1) Requirements:

* Java JDK >= 1.7 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnjp)
* Gradle >= 1.11 (http://www.gradle.org/)
* WixToolset >= 3.7 (http://wixtoolset.org/)
* Launch4J >= 3.4 (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/)
* Git
* Eclipse

Make sure to setup your JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to your JDK install. 
Make sure that the Gradle, WixToolset and Launch4j binaries are working from your terminal of choice, you may need to add them to PATH.

The installer gradle scripts have been developed for BASH. They *should* work on cmd.exe but may need some tweaking. If you're on windows I recommend getting MINGW. 

2) Getting started
Clone the source from github and run "gradle eclipse" in the project root to generate an eclipse project and download necessary dependencies. Then fire up eclipse and import the project.

3) Coding
A provided eclipse code formatting template name "EL" is provided. Use it, contributions that do not follow the formatting style will be rejected. 

4) Building for release:
At the project root, issue:

gradle -Pversion=1.x.y release

to compile, package a jar and build 32 and 64bit installers. These are then uploaded to github using the release function on github.com.
