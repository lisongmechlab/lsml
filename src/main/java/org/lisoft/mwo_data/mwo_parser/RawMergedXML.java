 * In the before times, all the data files lived happily in a single file called "ItemStats.xml".
 * Then the mean Grinch came and split the file up into multiple smaller, more manageable files that
 * still had the same structure and elements. This class facilitates merging all the smaller xml
 * files into one larger in-memory structure that can be use resolve references between elements,
 * inheritance and construct links between items (such as weapon to ammo).
