Li Song Mechlab
----------------
Li Song Mechlab (LSML) is a tool for building mech configurations for PGI's MechWarrior: Online. 

Download & Install
--------
Download a release installer from:
    
    http://li-soft.org

The installer will set everything up for you. If you're a hacker you can get the sources at:

    https://github.com/EmilyBjoerk/lsml

But be aware that without running the installer, the required registry keys for lsml:// links won't be installed and you will need to import them manually.

Requirements
------------
* Java 8 or later (http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
(Note: An up-to-date game install will be used to update program data if found)
