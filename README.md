# Li Song Mechlab (LSML)

## Overview

Li Song Mechlab (LSML) is an open-source 'Mech loadout creation and analysis tool designed to empower MechWarrior: Online players with accurate and comprehensive data for optimal loadout configurations. The tool focuses on providing essential numbers and statistics, allowing you to make informed decisions about your BattleMech loadouts.

## Key Features

- **Always Up-to-Date:** LSML reads data directly from your MechWarrior: Online game install, ensuring real-time updates with each patch. Even unreleased mechs are available in the data files.

- **Accurate Metrics:** Benefit from precise calculations for expected average damage and heat, including considerations for ghost heat, quirks, weapon jams, spread, spin-up, double fire, and other weapon properties.

- **Critical Hit Simulations:** Evaluate the survivability of components in combat through critical hit simulations.

- **Advanced Search:** Easily find mechs based on specific criteria, such as weapon loadouts, tonnage, speed, weapon quirks, and special equipment like jump-jets or ECM.

- **Compelling Graphs:** Visualize damage and alpha strike capabilities over range, with the ability to examine individual weapon groups.

- **Efficient Mech Building:** Utilize tools like [Smart Place](https://github.com/lisongmechlab/lsml/wiki/Smart-Place) and [Auto Armour](https://github.com/lisongmechlab/lsml/wiki/Automatic-Armor-Distribution) to build mechs quickly.

- **Comprehensive Mech Statistics:** Access [detailed information](https://github.com/lisongmechlab/lsml/wiki/Statistics) on turning rate, max angles, total damage capacity of ammo, and more.

- **Export/Import Loadouts:** Seamlessly transfer loadouts between LSML and the in-game Mechlab, avoiding the need to use PGI's Mechlab.

- **No Downtime:** LSML runs locally on your computer, eliminating dependency on remote servers and ensuring uninterrupted access.
